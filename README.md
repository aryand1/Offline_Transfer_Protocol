# 🗝️ One-Time Code Store in Java

Welcome to the **One-Time Code Store** Java project! This repository contains a simple implementation for generating and storing one-time codes associated with sensitive data. The `OneTimeCodeStore` class allows for secure management of one-time codes, ensuring that codes are used only once.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites 🛠️

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**: Ensure you have JDK installed on your machine.
- **An IDE or text editor**: For example, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

### Setup Instructions 📥

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/one-time-code-store.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd one-time-code-store
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Files:**
   ```bash
   javac OneTimeCodeStore.java
   ```

4. **Run the Java Program:**
   ```bash
   java OneTimeCodeStore
   ```

## 📜 Code Overview

### `OneTimeCodeStore.java`

This file contains two classes:

- **`OneTimeCodeStore`**: Manages the generation and retrieval of one-time codes.
- **`CardData`**: Stores sensitive information like card number, expiry date, and cardholder name.

#### Key Features:

- **Secure Code Generation**: Utilizes `SecureRandom` for generating unpredictable codes.
- **One-Time Use**: Codes are removed from storage after retrieval to ensure they are used only once.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Codes are URL-safe and easy to handle.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Ensure that sensitive data, like card details, is managed with care and comply with applicable data protection regulations.
- **One-Time Code Usage**: Codes are designed for single-use, providing an added layer of security.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- **Expiration Time**: Add functionality to expire codes after a certain time period.
- **Persistent Storage**: Implement persistent storage options to retain codes beyond the application's runtime.
